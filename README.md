## Introduction

The goal of this project is to predict house prices using machine learning algorithms. By analyzing a dataset with different features (such as location, size, number of rooms, etc.), the model can make informed predictions on housing prices. This is particularly useful for real estate analytics and investment.

## Dataset

This project uses a dataset that includes various features such as:
- House size
- Number of bedrooms and bathrooms
- Year of construction
- Location
- And more...

(Add specific information on where the dataset comes from, like Kaggle or any other source, if applicable.)

## Project Structure

The repository includes the following file:
- **House_Prices_Prediction.ipynb**: The Jupyter notebook that contains all steps of the project, including data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn

To install these libraries, use the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/House-Prices-Prediction.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd House-Prices-Prediction
```

3. Open the Jupyter notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook House_Prices_Prediction.ipynb
```

## Usage

The notebook covers the following steps:
1. Data exploration and visualization.
2. Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, etc.).
3. Model training using different machine learning algorithms, including:
   - Linear Regression
   - Decision Trees
   - Random Forest
   - XGBoost (if used)
4. Model evaluation using appropriate metrics (e.g., Mean Squared Error, R-squared).
5. Hyperparameter tuning and model optimization.

After running the notebook, you can experiment with the code to tweak models and improve performance.

## Model and Results

- Different machine learning models are trained to predict house prices.
- The performance of each model is evaluated, and visualizations of the predictions are included.
- The notebook includes comparisons between the models, showing the best approach for predicting house prices based on the dataset.
